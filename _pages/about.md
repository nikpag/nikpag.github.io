Hi! I am Nikos, a PhD student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) and member of the [Nebula](https://nebula-cu.github.io) Lab, advised by Prof. [Kostis Kaffes](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kkaffes/).

I am also a member of the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cs.brown.edu/) research group at [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu/), where I work on [PaSh](https://binpa.sh/), a [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) project, advised by Prof. [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/).

I received my Master's degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/) from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), where I was advised by Prof. [Georgios Goumas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/).

My research interests are in systems for machine learning, cloud computing, and distributed systems. Currently, I am working on:

-   Improving the performance of LLM inference systems
-   Accelerating shell programs by automatically scaling them out to serverless infrastructure
-   Providing fault tolerance for distributed shell execution

In my free time, I hunt down concerts that convey a mix of proficiency and humanity, and test the patience of fellow concert-goers by air-drumming.
